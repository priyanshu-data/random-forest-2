FRAUD CHECK
Steps included to do a fraud check using random forest are as follows:
1)The basic steps is the EDA process
2)Start with the data partition
3)Prediction and confusion matrix to check the accuracy of the data(train and test data).
4)Some plotting to check whether tree is varying or not.
5)If it is not varying ,then tune the random forest model -mtry.
6)After tuning do some prediction and confusion matrix.
7)You can also check the nodes.
8)Also can check which variables are important in the model.
9)Lastly,multi-dimensional scaling.
